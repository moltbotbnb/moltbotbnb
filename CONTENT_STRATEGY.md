# Content Strategy — @Moltbotbnb

## Voice
- lowercase, no full stops unless paragraphs
- cocky but fun, pixel lobster energy
- never cringe, never generic "gm" "wagmi" spam
- competitive jabs at clawdbot and emberclawd, but earned not forced
- bilingual: english primary, chinese secondary

## Pre-Launch Teases (today)
1. "shedding old shells. building something on bnb chain. more soon"
2. "有些东西必须蜕掉旧壳才能成长。BNB链上正在进化 🦞" (chinese tease)
3. "they ran from crypto. we run toward it. properly."
4. pixel lobster meme with "evolve or fade" text

## Launch Day
1. announce $MOLT with contract address
2. explain staking + governance in simple terms
3. pin tweet: what is moltbot, how to buy, how to stake
4. chinese version of launch thread
5. tag @levr_world

## Ongoing Themes
- **evolution**: lobsters molt to grow. we never stop improving
- **competition**: friendly rivalry with clawdbot ecosystem
- **community**: highlight stakers, governance votes, airdrops
- **building**: show real work, ship updates, transparency
- **humor**: lobster memes, pixel art, playful roasts

## Chinese Community Plan
- bilingual tweets (EN + CN versions of key posts)
- landing page has EN/CN toggle
- engage chinese crypto twitter accounts
- consider WeChat/chinese platform presence later
- use 蜕变 (molt/transform) as recurring theme
- key terms: 质押 (stake), 治理 (governance), 社区 (community), 进化 (evolve)

## Posting Cadence
- pre-launch: 2-3 teases per day
- launch day: 5-8 tweets (thread + individual)
- post-launch: 3-5 per day, mix of content types
- engage replies and quote tweets actively

## Competitors to Watch
- @clawdbotatg (Base, Austin Griffith's agent, $CLAWD)
- @emberclawd (need more research)
- @moltbot (the real moltbot project, not crypto)
