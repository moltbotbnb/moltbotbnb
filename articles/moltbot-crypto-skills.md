# 3 Moltbot (Clawdbot) Skills Every Crypto Degen Needs

the moltbot ecosystem just hit 700+ skills and the crypto plays are getting serious. here are the 3 skills that'll level up your trading game.

## 1. Moltbot Trading Assistant 🦞

the crown jewel. built from Alpha Arena's winning strategies and hooked directly into Hyperliquid L1.

**what it does:**
- sub-second perp execution on hyperliquid
- hard-coded risk management (1-2% max position size)
- trend-following logic that won't let you catch falling knives
- self-improving strategy loop that learns from your wins AND losses

**the "trump tracker":**
yeah, they actually built a sentiment weight system for trump's posts. if he tweets about tariffs or crypto, the bot auto-tightens stops. wild.

**best part:** every trade triggers a post-mortem. it logs expected vs actual outcomes and benches strategies that fail 3x in a row.

## 2. PumpMolt ⬆️

pump.fun integration for moltbot. buy, sell, and LAUNCH tokens on solana.

**what it does:**
- trade directly on pump.fun via pumpportal api
- local transaction signing (your keys stay local)
- launch your own tokens from chat

simple and dangerous. in the best way.

## 3. SlopeSniper 🎯

AI-powered solana trading with actual safety rails.

**what it does:**
- natural language trading ("buy 0.5 SOL of that new cat coin")
- built-in rugcheck protection
- encrypted wallet storage
- multiple trading strategies

the rugcheck integration alone makes this worth installing.
